	  community supported Update Modules. An Update Module is an
	  extension to the Mender client for supporting a new type of
	  software update, such as a package manager, container,
	  bootloader or even updates of nearby microcontrollers.
	  An Update Module can be tailored to a specific device or
	  environment (e.g. update a proprietary bootloader), or be
	  more general-purpose (e.g. install a set of .deb packages.).

config BR2_PACKAGE_MENDER_UPDATE_MODULES_DFU
	bool "DFU"
	help
	  The DFU Update Module is able to update peripheral devices
	  connected to the device running Mender.
	  Example use-cases:
	    - Deploy firmware updates to peripheral devices using the
	      USB Device Firmware Update (DFU) protocol

	  https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-update-modules/tree/master/dfu

config BR2_PACKAGE_MENDER_UPDATE_MODULES_DIR_OVERLAY
	bool "dir-overlay"
	help
	  The Directory Overlay Update Module installs a user defined
	  file tree structure into a given destination directory in the
	  target.

	  Before the deploy into the destination folder on the device,
	  the Update Module will take a backup copy of the current
	  contents, allowing restore of it using the rollback mechanism
	  of the Mender client if something goes wrong. The Update
	  Module will also delete the current installed content that was
	  previously installed using the same module, this means that
	  each deployment is self contained and there is no residues
	  left on the system from the previous deployment.

	  Example use-cases:
	    - Deploy root filesystem overlays

config BR2_PACKAGE_MENDER_UPDATE_MODULES_DIRTY
	bool "dirty"
	help
	  The dirty Update Module: modify your device state without
	  installing an artifact
	  Example use-cases:
	    - You have a specific action on the device that you want to
	      run multiple times

	    - You want to avoid re-creating artifacts just for the sake
	      of a new version/name

	    - You don't want the artifact the show up in the list of
	      installed artifacts

	    - The module will always fail the update process, which
	      means it can never be marked as installed. So it can be
	      attempted any number of times without having to recreate
	      newly versioned artifacts.

	help
	  The reboot Update Module: reboot your device remotely.

	  Example use-cases:
	    - Something went wrong and you have to reboot your device
	      remotely, and all access to the device you have is Mender.

	help
	  The rootfs-version-check Update Module implements a full image
	  update with additional checks to protect against replay
	  attacks.

	  This is functionally equivalent to the built-in full image
	  update with an extra check to ensure the artifact name
	  follows a specific format and that installing "older" images
	  is rejected. For this reference implementaton, we simply use
	  a numeric identifier and ensure that it is larger than the
	  version installed. For actual device fleet use, you may need
	  to customize this based on your artifact naming scheme.

	  Example use-cases:
	    - Deploy root filesystem updates and ensure only newer
	      artifacts are installed
