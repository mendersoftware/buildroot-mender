	  LMDB is an ultra-fast, ultra-compact key-value embedded data
	  store developed by Symas for the OpenLDAP Project. By using
	  memory-mapped files, it provides the read performance of a
	  pure in-memory database while still offering the persistence
	  of standard disk-based databases, and is only limited to the
	  size of the virtual address space.
